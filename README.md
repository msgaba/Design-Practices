## Concepts Used
- Used View binding
- Used kotlin extension function for managing visibility of views which makes code more readable.
- Created a class "Base Fragment" consisting a piece of static code required to create a class.
- Instead of using hard coded string in xmls and classes, strings added in "strings.xml" and used via getString() method.
- Instead of using hard coded dimension values in xmls, added dimensions in "dimen.xml" and thereafter used.
- Instead of using color codes directly in xmls, added colors in "colors.xml" and thereafter used.
- Depicting back button functionality when more than one fragments are used in a activity.
- Used variables to manage view in order to avoid writing repetitive code.
## Design
Design is kept minimalistic and simple. All images used are svg files downloaded online from different sources.
## Objective
Objective of this was just to depict standard practices which should be used while designing app in kotlin using View binding
